# SVG-Generator

## Description

- The purpose of this this challenge was to create an svg generator application. This generator application asks four questions (text, text color, shape, and shape color) regarding the logo the user wishes to generate. On completion, a new svg file is created along with the actual code that is needed to generate the logo. Another requirement of this projet is to test the classes I wrote using Jest to ensure my code is passable. This is a useful project that solves the issue of possibly requiring a graphic designer to create a simple and personal logo. From this project, I have learned that it is fun to see my work turn into something that is useful and it also very rewarding to look at how far I've grown in my coding career!


## Installation

- To be able to use this application, nodejs and the inquirer package should be installed to user's machine. Specifically for this project, Jest is used to test the code I created. Provided below are links to the required packages.

    Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    Inquirer package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4

    Jest: https://jestjs.io/



## Usage
- The way to use this application is provided through the video link below. User must simply provide answers to the questions asked from the command line to generate a new svg file.
